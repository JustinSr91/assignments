They are the tallest player on the court, and often, the most exciting player to watch Skills needed for this position are: Good footwork, jumping, rebounding, great defensive skills such as blocking and physicality, and the ability to use pivot moves to position their body to make short range jumpshots, hookshots, and even dunks! </p>

          class="image__AnthonyDavis">A Power Forward is considered a more athletic version of the Center. They are a tad bit smaller in size than a Center, but still just as bulky and muscular. They hold the same responsibilites as the Center such as rebounding, scoring in the paint, and defensive skills. Their primary scoring area is up to 15 feet away from the basket.

        Small Forward
        <p class="NBA__players"> <img src="http://media.cleveland.com/cavs_impact/photo/lebron-james-kobe-bryant-91efe0d5fdb91cc9.jpg" alt="Lebron James" class="image__LeBron">The Small Forward is considered the all-purpose player on offense. They are athletic and skilled enough to handle the ball on the outside on the perimeter as well as in the paint. Normally they can shoot the ball very well and can score farther away from the basket than a Power Forward.

        Shooting Guard
        <p class="NBA__players"> <img src="http://www.interbasket.net/news/wp-content/uploads/Kobe-Bryant-signature-fadeaway-jumper.jpeg" alt="Kobe">The Shooting Guard specializes in exactly what their name suggests: Shooting the ball. They are exceptionally quick and athletic, and are typically smaller in size than a Small Forward, but occasionally just as tall. They are not known for using their size to score inside the paint, but can use their speed and quickness to dart to the basket off the dribble. Their main strengths are shooting and passing the ball.

        Point Guard
        <p class="NBA__players"> <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/04/sports/04CURRYweb4/04CURRYweb4-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry" class="image__StephCurry">Often called the most important player on the court, like the Quarterback in football, the Point Guards' best attributes are typically ball handling, passing, and occasionally shooting. They are the shortest but quickest player on the court. Their decision making, leadership, and ability to get to the basket quickly is what makes them most effective.
