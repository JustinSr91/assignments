// Create a variable to calculate Tim's age

// The answer shoud not be written in a comment.
var born = 1983;
var today = 2015;

// Answers Below:

console.log("Tim is " + timCurrentAge + " years old");


// Store some information following in variables.
var yourName= "Justin Strayhorn"
var instructorName= "Jason Vanderslice"

// Update the variables above so the expression reads correctly.
// Answers Below:


// Final Statement
var statement = yourName + " is taking a class at The Iron Yard, my instructor's name is " + instructorName;
console.log(yourName + " is taking a class at The Iron Yard, my instructor's name is " + instructorName);


// Today at The Iron Yard we learned about the language Javascript and various Javascript syntaxes such as Object and Array.

// Javascript is a language that provides object oriented programming to web pages and browsers.
// It can be used to control and manipulate web pages on both server-side and client-side. The main uses of Javascript are to text changes on the web page, text box creation, pop up messages, and user interaction.

// An object is a variable that refers to a collection of properties and types which defines the variablesâ€™ characteristics. It allows for the addition of certain details of a set variable.

// An Array is used to store multiple values in a single variable. It is identified by braces [ ] .
// Elements in an array are numbered starting at 0. The second element would then be numbered at 1.
